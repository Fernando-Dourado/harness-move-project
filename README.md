## Install

Download the latest version from [releases page](https://github.com/jf781/harness-move-project/releases/latest)

## Requirements

- The tool does not create the target Organization.  It must be pre-existing
- As safety operation, the tool do not delete the entities from the source project.
- The `api-key` need to have access to read from the source project and write to the target project.
- You can run it multiple times, when the same entity already exists in the target project we ignore it and do not report it as an error.

## Usage

Execute the operation running at the following command in your terminal that will read from a CSV file. 


```sh
./harness-move-project \
  --apiToken <SAT_OR_PAT> \
  --accountId <account_identifier> \
  --csvPath ./exampleCsvFile.csv \
  --baseUrl https://app.harness.io
```

By default it will only create the target project in the target organization. It will not copy any of the components to the target organization.  

You have the option to copy only Continuous Delivery or Feature Flag components, or both setting the follow parameters.  You can set both to true if you want to copy all components. 

```sh
--copyCDComponents true
```

```sh
--copyFFComponents true
```

When the tool try to create and entity on target project that the same identifier already exist, it silently ignores the error and continues the execution. Using that strategy you can run it multiple times without side effects.

## CSV File

You can run this against a single or multiple projects by providing a CSV file with the following format:

| CSV column Name | Description | Required |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `sourceOrg` | The name of source organization | Yes |
| `sourceProject` | The name of source project | Yes |
| `targetOrg` | The name of target organization | Yes |
| `targetProject` | The name of target project | No |

If the `targetProject` is not provided, the tool will use the `sourceProject` as the target project name.

There is an example CSV file named `exampleCsvFile.csv` that you can update with your project details.
